---

Welcome to the Minimalist Web Hugo theme! This theme embraces a monospace-first design philosophy inspired by [The Monospace Web](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/).

## What is Monospace-First Design?

Instead of using proportional fonts for body text and reserving monospace fonts for code, this theme uses monospace fonts throughout the entire interface.

### Benefits

- **Visual consistency**: Single typeface family eliminates noise
- **Character-based grid**: Layout aligns to character-sized increments
- **Terminal aesthetic**: Evokes retro computing while remaining modern
- **Code-friendly**: No jarring font switches between text and code

## Typography Examples

Here's how different elements look:

### Headers Work Great

Even at different sizes, monospace fonts maintain their distinctive character.

#### Subheadings Too

The consistent character width makes everything feel cohesive.

### Lists

Unordered lists:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with more text to show wrapping behavior

Ordered lists:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, monospace world!")
    return True
```

### Blockquotes

> The beauty of monospace is in its simplicity and honesty. Every character takes the same space, creating a visual rhythm that's both functional and aesthetic.
