# About This Theme

The Minimalist Web Hugo theme is inspired by [The Monospace Web](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/) project by Oskar Wickström.

## Design Philosophy

This theme follows a few key principles:

1. **Monospace everywhere**: Uses monospace fonts throughout the entire site
2. **Character-based layout**: Measurements use `ch` units instead of pixels
3. **Minimalist aesthetic**: Clean, distraction-free design
4. **Automatic dark mode**: Respects system color scheme preferences
5. **ASCII art support**: First-class support for box-drawing characters

## Technical Details

## Credits
